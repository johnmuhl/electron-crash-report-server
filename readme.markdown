**electron-crash-report-server** is a Node.js ([hapi]) and PostgreSQL
([massive]) application for collecting crash reports from Electron applications.

## install

[![Deploy][deploy-img]][deploy-url]

During setup change the `AUTH_USER` and `AUTH_PASS` environment variables. Once
the app has deployed use those values to login.

### docker

üê≥ `electron-crash-report-server` is available on Docker Hub. Refer to the
[`docker-compose.yaml`][docker-compose] file for usage.

---

_If crash reports do not appear after the first deploy restart the app._

Read the [**development**](#development) section for information about running
in other environments.

## usage

```javascript
const { crashReporter } = require("electron");
crashReporter.start({
	// ...other options
	submitURL: "https://app-name-12345.herokuapp.com/",
});
```

Refer to the [`crashReporter` documentation][docs] for the full details.

**Important**: Don't forget to start the `crashReporter` in the main process
_and each renderer that will create crash reports_.

Check out the [example electron app][example] and [demo server][demo] for a
working example. The login and password for the demo are **`crash`** and
**`electron`**.

If there are no sample reports use the [example] (or any other) app to add some
reports to the demo server.

## github & gitlab

`electron-crash-report-server` can create new issues on GitHub and/or GitLab
when it receives a crash report. Using a private repository for these issues is
recommended since stack traces and dump files may contain sensitive information
about your users or application.

- [GitHub demo](https://github.com/johnmuhl/crash-reports/issues)
- [GitLab demo](https://gitlab.com/johnmuhl/crash-reports/issues)

To get setup you need to add a few environment variables.

### github & gitlab

Both services require you to set `ECRS_URL`; **note the lack of trailing
slash**.

```toml
ECRS_URL = "https://pacific-falls-32011.herokuapp.com"
```

### github

```toml
GITHUB_OWNER = "user_name"
GITHUB_REPO = "repo_name"
GITHUB_TOKEN = "user_token"
```

### gitlab

```toml
GITLAB_ID = "repo_id"
GITLAB_TOKEN = "user_token"
```

## email

`electron-crash-report-server` can send an email when it receives a crash
report.

```toml
SMTP_LOGIN = "postmaster@xxx.mailgun.org"
SMTP_PASSWORD = "password is secret"
SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.mailgun.org"
SMTP_PORT = "587"
SMTP_TO = "support@example.org"
SMTP_FROM = "ecrs@example.org"
SMTP_SUBJECT = "`ecrs: Crash report ${document.id}`"
```

üö® `SMTP_SUBJECT` is `eval`ed at runtime so be careful what you include; a
malicious user may be able to craft a crash report that executes code on your
server.

## development

**Requirements**: Node.js LTS 10.x and PostgreSQL 11.x.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/johnmuhl/electron-crash-report-server
cd electron-crash-report-server
createdb electron_crash_report_server_development
cp .env.example .env
yarn install
yarn start:dev
# make changes
yarn fmt
yarn test
```
